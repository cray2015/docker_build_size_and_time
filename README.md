## Why smaller docker build and faster build are beneficial

Smaller Docker images and faster build times have **practical, performance, and security benefits** â€” especially in DevOps, CI/CD, and production environments.

### ðŸš€ **Benefits of Smaller Docker Images**

1. **Faster Pull & Push**

   * Smaller images upload/download more quickly, saving time in CI/CD pipelines and deployments.

2. **Lower Bandwidth Costs**

   * Especially critical in cloud environments or when scaling across regions.

3. **Reduced Attack Surface**

   * Minimal base images (like `alpine`, `distroless`) include fewer packages, making them **less vulnerable** to exploits.

4. **Faster Startup Times**

   * Less data to load â†’ containers start more quickly, improving cold start times (especially in serverless or auto-scaling setups).

5. **Efficient Caching & Layer Reuse**

   * Smaller layers are reused more effectively, speeding up rebuilds and updates.

### âš¡ **Benefits of Faster Docker Build Times**

1. **Increased Developer Productivity**

   * Faster iteration cycles lead to more time spent coding, less time waiting.

2. **Speedy CI/CD Pipelines**

   * Faster builds â†’ quicker testing, QA, and deployment stages.

3. **Better Developer Experience (DX)**

   * Fast local builds reduce friction when onboarding or troubleshooting.

4. **Enables More Frequent Deployments**

   * Especially useful for microservices or teams practicing continuous deployment.

5. **Lower Compute Costs**

   * Faster builds consume fewer CPU/memory cycles in build servers or cloud runners.



### Things to follow
- Use alpine image where possible
- Use multistage docker build
- Use .dockerignore
- strip out dev dependencies in production
- Use cleanup with --no-cache, --no-cache-dir, apt clean, apk cache clean etc.
- Combine RUN commands to reduce the docker layers
- Reuse a custom build image
- Use Buildkit (advanced)
- Using distroless base images (advanced)



### .dockerignore file example

    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    *.pyd
    *.log
    .env
    venv/
    .idea/
    .vscode/
    .git
    .dockerignore
    Dockerfile-dev


### Good example of Dockerfile

    # Stage 1: Builder
    FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder

    # Install system dependencies for building Python packages
    RUN apk add --no-cache build-base

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy only requirements to leverage Docker caching
    COPY requirements.txt .
    
    # Install dependencies into /install
    RUN pip install --prefix=/install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Stage 2: Runtime
    FROM python:3.11-alpine

    # Install runtime dependencies (no dev tools)
    RUN apk add --no-cache libstdc++ libffi

    # Copy installed packages from builder stage
    COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
    
    # Copy application code
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app

    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 8000
    
    # Run the app
    CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
