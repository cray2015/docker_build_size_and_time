## Why smaller docker build and faster build are beneficial

Smaller Docker images and faster build times have **practical, performance, and security benefits** — especially in DevOps, CI/CD, and production environments.

### 🚀 **Benefits of Smaller Docker Images**

1. **Faster Pull & Push**

   * Smaller images upload/download more quickly, saving time in CI/CD pipelines and deployments.

2. **Lower Bandwidth Costs**

   * Especially critical in cloud environments or when scaling across regions.

3. **Reduced Attack Surface**

   * Minimal base images (like `alpine`, `distroless`) include fewer packages, making them **less vulnerable** to exploits.

4. **Faster Startup Times**

   * Less data to load → containers start more quickly, improving cold start times (especially in serverless or auto-scaling setups).

5. **Efficient Caching & Layer Reuse**

   * Smaller layers are reused more effectively, speeding up rebuilds and updates.

### ⚡ **Benefits of Faster Docker Build Times**

1. **Increased Developer Productivity**

   * Faster iteration cycles lead to more time spent coding, less time waiting.

2. **Speedy CI/CD Pipelines**

   * Faster builds → quicker testing, QA, and deployment stages.

3. **Better Developer Experience (DX)**

   * Fast local builds reduce friction when onboarding or troubleshooting.

4. **Enables More Frequent Deployments**

   * Especially useful for microservices or teams practicing continuous deployment.

5. **Lower Compute Costs**

   * Faster builds consume fewer CPU/memory cycles in build servers or cloud runners.



### Things to follow
- Use alpine image where possible
- Use multistage docker build
- USe .dockerignore
- strip out dev dependencies in production
- Use cleanup with --no-cache, --no-cache-dir, apt clean, apk cache clean etc.
- Combine RUN commands to reduce the docker layers
- Reuse a custom build image
- Use Buildkit (advanced)
- Using distroless base images (advanced)



### .dockerignore file example

    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    *.pyd
    *.log
    .env
    venv/
    .idea/
    .vscode/
    .git
    .dockerignore
    Dockerfile-dev


### Good example of Dockerfile

    # Stage 1: Builder
    FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder

    # Install system dependencies for building Python packages
    RUN apk add --no-cache build-base

    # Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy only requirements to leverage Docker caching
    COPY requirements.txt .
    
    # Install dependencies into /install
    RUN pip install --prefix=/install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Stage 2: Runtime
    FROM python:3.11-alpine

    # Install runtime dependencies (no dev tools)
    RUN apk add --no-cache libstdc++ libffi

    # Copy installed packages from builder stage
    COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
    
    # Copy application code
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app

    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 8000
    
    # Run the app
    CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]





## issue

i have a rasp pi in which I installed docker, in order to expose docker engine on the network I created a daemon json in /etc/docker/ and the content were as follows

{ 
  "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
}

I also had to change the docker service (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service), I changed the exec command to "ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock" and commented the previous command "ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock" this way I was able to start the service and expose on network now I wanted to close this network exposure so I reverted everything. reverted to old exec command and also moved the daemon json to a bck folder in /etc/docker dir. but after daemon reload and service restart when I do a "docker ps" it says "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?"

what is the root cause of this and how to resolve it? 


### solution

The issue you're facing is that after reverting your changes, Docker is no longer binding to the expected Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`), which is what the `docker` CLI uses by default to communicate with the Docker daemon.

Here’s a breakdown of what likely went wrong and how to fix it:

---

### 🔍 Root Cause:

When you:

1. Created `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with:

   ```json
   {
     "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
   }
   ```

   This explicitly told Docker to bind to both the TCP socket and the Unix socket.

2. Modified the systemd unit file to use:

   ```ini
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
   ```

   This allowed `dockerd` to read the daemon.json and bind to those sockets.

3. When you **reverted**, you:

   * Restored the `ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock`
   * Moved (instead of deleted) the `daemon.json`

But **you forgot one critical step**: `-H fd://` requires that the systemd unit uses `Socket activation` via the `docker.socket` unit, and that might be either inactive, masked, or not properly linked anymore.

---

### ✅ Fix Steps:

#### 1. **Ensure `docker.socket` is active:**

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask docker.socket
sudo systemctl enable docker.socket
sudo systemctl start docker.socket
```

#### 2. **Check status:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker.socket
sudo systemctl status docker.service
```

#### 3. **Restart Docker properly:**

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker.socket
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### 4. **Test it:**

```bash
docker info
docker ps
```

### 🧹 Optional Cleanup:

* You can delete or restore the original `daemon.json` if you’re not customizing any settings.
* Make sure there are no conflicting custom options elsewhere (e.g., in `/etc/default/docker` or drop-ins in `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/`).
